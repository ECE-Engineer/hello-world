Currently I'm enrolled in a 4-year Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) BS program.
My Dream goal is to invent something that will change the world for the better & I want to make 
that contribution to future space exploration. I feel that there is so much potential for humans to someday 
inhabit other worlds and I want to make a huge contribution to make that dream a reality.

Some of my hobbies include playing the trumpet, collecting rocks & minerals from around the country, playing
division III tennis, being in the Robotics club, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) club, 
the Computer Science Association (CSA), the Math club, the table tennis club, being a volunteer, referee and a mentor for FIRST Lego League (FLL) student's.

Some of my major accomplishments are being elected the American Legion's Boy's State city and county chairman, I was also
appointed to be the secretary of Boy's State, I was one of three selected students to be a chairman's presenter for the
FIRST Penfield robotics team (1511).
